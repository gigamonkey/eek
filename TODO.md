# TODO

- ~Indicate whether answer was correct or incorrect and show correct answer if needed~

- Put cards directly in HTML.

- Some kind of progress indicator. Maybe a cheese emoji each time you get a
  question right. Or maybe a cheese emoji for each question that fades in as the
  question moves through the piles.

- Something better than a blank screen when you answer all the questions. Maybe
  a score page that lists all the questions and how many times you answered each
  one correctly and incorrectly.

- Write actual CSA cards.
